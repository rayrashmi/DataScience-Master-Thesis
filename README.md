🇬🇧 Social Media Toxicity Classification (Brexit Tweets)

This project builds a machine learning and deep learning pipeline to classify toxic vs non-toxic tweets in the context of the UK Brexit debate. It includes preprocessing, weak-supervision labeling, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.

🚀 Key Features

TF–IDF based text representation

Logistic Regression baseline

Multi-Layer Perceptron (Deep Learning)

Confusion matrices, ROC curves, F1-scores

Lexicon-based weak supervision for labeling

Exploratory analysis of toxic vs non-toxic language

📊 Results (Summary)
Model	Accuracy	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	75%	72%	0.78
MLP (Deep Learning)	80%	78%	0.86

MLP outperforms the baseline, especially for context-dependent toxicity.
